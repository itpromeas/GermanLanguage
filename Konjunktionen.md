## 1. Coordinating vs. Subordinating Conjunctions

In German grammar, conjunctions come in two types: German coordinating conjunctions and German subordinating conjunctions. 
The first type coordinates two clauses that are equally important, while the second type subordinates one clause to another. 

German conjunctions and word order go hand-in-hand. In other word, there are German conjunctions that don’t change word order, 
and German conjunctions that change word order.

When you use subordinating conjunctions, make the verb go to the end of the clause that is introduced by the conjunction. 
When using coordinating conjunctions, the verb stays in the same position. 



    Coordinating conjunctions will be signed with a ‘C’
    Subordinating conjunctions will be signed with an ‘S’


# 2. German Correlative Conjunctions

*Und* (C) 

Meaning: And

Example:
Ich bin ein netter Mensch und du bist ebenso freundlich.
I’m a nice person, and you are friendly as well.

Usage: You’ll use und all the time. It’s one of the most common German conjunctions to express similar thoughts, 
and the most basic one. It’s also used to combine more than one adjective, verb, or noun.
