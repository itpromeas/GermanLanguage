## 1. Coordinating vs. Subordinating Conjunctions

In German grammar, conjunctions come in two types: German coordinating conjunctions and German subordinating conjunctions. 
The first type coordinates two clauses that are equally important, while the second type subordinates one clause to another. 

German conjunctions and word order go hand-in-hand. In other word, there are German conjunctions that donâ€™t change word order, 
and German conjunctions that change word order.

When you use subordinating conjunctions, make the verb go to the end of the clause that is introduced by the conjunction. 
When using coordinating conjunctions, the verb stays in the same position.
